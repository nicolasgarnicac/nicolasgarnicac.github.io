            <p style="color: #787878; text-align: left;">Pneumonia is a common disease that affects the lungs of the patient, generating inflammation and obstruction of the intake airways, which can lead to suffocation and death. The principal reason behind this disease is the contact of external
                microorganisms with the lung parenchyma, and the action of the immune system to fight the infection is what causes the inflammation. The most common microorganisms found responsible for the pneumonia infection are either bacterial or viral
                in origin; these microorganisms are present in the air, which makes them easy to inhale while breathing.</p>
